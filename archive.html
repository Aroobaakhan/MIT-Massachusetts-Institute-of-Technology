            As MIT begins this new year, President Kornbluth wrote to the community to name the challenges she has been seeing and hearing about since the fall semester, and announced steps to begin solving them together. She named four areas for immediate attention: benchmarking and improving student disciplinary processes; developing a deeper understanding of the rights and responsibilities of free expression; making sure DEI programs effectively meet our campus’s needs; and adding targeted questions to our regular campus climate survey. “These Institute-level actions will help us make thoughtful, evidence-based improvements in some key systems and programs, improvements that will serve the people of MIT well not only in this difficult period but far beyond it,” she wrote.
